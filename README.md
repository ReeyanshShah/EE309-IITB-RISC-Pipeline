We developed a 6-stage pipelined processor named IITB-RISC, based on a provided instruction set architecture. IITB-RISC is a 16-bit computer system with 8 registers, designed for educational purposes at IIT Bombay. It follows a standard 6-stage pipeline: instruction fetch, instruction decode, register read, execute, memory access, and write back. The architecture is optimized for performance, incorporating hazard mitigation techniques and a data forwarding mechanism to enhance efficiency.
